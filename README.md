- Ensure that the webhook url https://DOMAIN.TLD/api/webhooks is added with the user.created and user.deleted events
- You will need up a webhook to point to https://<domain.tld>/api/webhooks, and ensure you use the "Signing Secret" from the webhook as your CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET environment variable...
- For the Headers: please generate an Unkey key and pass it in the headers as a Bearer token for the webhook

## Styling

The tailwind.config.js file will contain a list of themes that are added by default. To change the theme, change the value of "data-theme" on the html tag in src/app/layout.tsx. For more information on DaisyUI themes, please see their [documentation](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/).
